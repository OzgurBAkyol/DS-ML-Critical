The notes for myself from me

# Data Transformation
* Why Transformation of features required ?
* First of all, there is no meaning in making a machine learning model without transformation.
* These are some mathematical transformations that makes the data more useful for  us.
* This is also known as future engineering, Which is creating new features from existing ones.


# Dill Pypi
* Dill extends python's pickle module for serializing and de-serializing python objects to the majority of the built-in python types.
* Serialization is the process of converting an object to a byte stream, and the inverse of which is converting a byte stream back to a python object hierarchy.
* dill provides the user the same interface as the pickle module, and also includes some additional features. In addition to pickling python objects, dill provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter session in a single command.

# Residuals
* Residuals in a statistical or machine learning model are the differences between observed and predicted values of data. 
* They are a diagnostic measure used when assessing the quality of a model.
* They are also known as errors.
* WHY are residuals important ? 
* They're determining the quality of the model.
* You can examine residuals in terms of their magnitude and/or whether they form a pattern.

# Configuration File
* Wikipedia says : In computing, configuration files (or config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs.
*  They are used for user applications, server processes, and operating system settings.
